 ### Report of Process
 This homework is really interesting. First difficulty I met is to choose a proper website. I try to download data from -[website](https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings.jsp), however, I can't find the right css of quality of life index here, I can only get the information of countries. The reason I think is that these data don't have a "class" but only have a "style". Thus, I changed a webstie and try to get the data from the billboard. The most difficult part is to set the right link for each singer, you have to use stingr package to replace some unuseful strings.Besides, some singer's name is not totally match with our designed link, so I check it by myself for each singer. As for the data analysis part, it is easy and just like what we did before.
