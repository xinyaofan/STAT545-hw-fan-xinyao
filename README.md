## Report
### I use two methods to edit my README file
- Open the README file in R studio, and make changes locally. After making changes in the file, save the files and then commit and push to the github. Before you click "push", usually it's a good habit to click "pull", because it can help us to make sure everything is up to date. I have to say, R studio is a good txt editor for github. Editing the R markdown document is the same, you can make changes in the R markdown file(created in R studio), and then commit and push to github.
- Make changes in the brower at github. This is also a good way to make changes in the file. A useful tip is that before you commit your changes, you can preview. 
### Difficulties
Since I have never used markdown before, it's difficult for me to produce a tidy and beautiful format.For example, I don't know how to insert contiguous spaces in the file, later I googled and found that I should type *&emsp;*to insert space. After reading some helpful [tutorials](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) about the markdown syntax, things become better.
